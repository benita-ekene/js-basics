<h3>Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category</h3>

<h4>Statically typed programming language</h4>
 In Statically typed programming language, type checking is performed during compile time. It means that the type of a variable is known at compile time.<br>
 Example of Statically typed programming language are:<br>
 - C<br>
 - C++ <br>
 - Java <br>
With Static Typing, variables generally are not allowed to change types.

<h4>Dynamically typed programming language</h4>
In dynamically typed programming language, type checking is performed at runtime. For example, Python is a dynamically typed language. It means that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime. <br>
Other dynamically typed languages are:<br>
- Perl <br>
- Ruby <br>
- PHP <br>
- Javascript
